## Overview 
The program "selection_of_optimal_stations.py" enabling the selection of optimal stations from among the existing networks of measurement stations to determine the spatial average value of the measured environmental parameter in the studied area.

The program "optimal_stations_network.py" calculates the optimum location of the network of measurement sites for determining the spatial mean value of the measured environmental parameter in the study area. The calculation is performed using a genetic algorithm on the basis of a time series of spatial data stored in a NetCDF file.

## Usage
See the example Jupyter notebooks (optimal_stations_network.ipynb, selection_of_optimal_stations.ipynb). 

## Data
Data for measuring stations in the Baltic Sea SST and chlorophyll a are available in the ./data catalog

Spatial data for the Baltic Sea in netCDF files are available in the data repository:
